# Project Information

Digify is an open source project built to give especially german schools a better perspective.
There are no real open source digital classbooks on the market and therefore it is hard
for german schools to use a digital classbook that is also privacy orientated. Therefore, I
built this project. It is built with the asp .NET framework to provide a large scalability 
and maintainability. Furthermore, it is fast and intuitive. 

# Development status

The project is not finished yet. Because of the lack of features and security tests it is
not ready yet for the production use. But feel free to set it up yourself and play arround with
the interface and the configuration options. 

# Feature requests

If there is any important feature missing feel free to submit a new issue. I will take a look at it
and validate how important it is and how it can be improve the usability of the project.
